* v0.1 (2009-03-11)

First deploy, including legacy data (MusicStrands co-occurrences, songs, artists, genres) in a zipped archive. The Web interface allows navigation between the models, but does not yet include a model for associations and evaluation; only co-occurrence counts and distances are shown.
